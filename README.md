# Demenagement_java

## Project created in order to learn Java basics

This program asks the user to  give a number of boxes (it must be an integer) ans the maximum capacity of the truck (must be an integer too).

When done, the program lists the travels done by the truck with the number of boxes that are moved, until the moving out is finished.
