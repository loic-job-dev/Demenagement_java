## Description
A small Java program to calculate the number of trips required to move a certain number of boxes, based on the truck's maximum capacity.

## How it works
- The user inputs:
    1. **Total number of boxes** (positive integer)
    2. **Maximum truck capacity** (positive integer)
- The program displays the list of trips made and the number of boxes transported on each trip until the move is complete.

- An IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA** or a terminal with `javac` and `java`
